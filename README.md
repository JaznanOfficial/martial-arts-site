# Let's fun with my second react love exam :) Just joking!

At first let's see  [my Second React Love.](https://react-martial-arts-site.netlify.app/).

* It’s an online martial arts learning site and only a front-end site.
* Visitors can see many martial arts courses. But not added register or login system
* It’s a very fast reloadable and one-page application



* It was my second react site. it was somthing hard more than another assignment but easier than first react assignment. You'll see i created a martial arts teaching site.Because i tried to do different something than others
* in this site i used home,services,about,contact and accepted router. it was my new experience. i tried to do my best.
* most notable thing is, i got a error...and wasted my lot of time for that..finally i got solution. that is i didn't import one css file in thats javascript file. that's for today..see you another day inshallah...allah hafej
