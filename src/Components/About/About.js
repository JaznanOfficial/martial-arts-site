            <h3>
                Fight School has specialized in martial arts since 1986 and has one of the most
                innovative programs in the nation.
            </h3>

            <h6>
                We teach martial arts because we love it â€” not because we want to make money on you.
                Unlike other martial arts schools, we do not require you to sign long term
                contracts. You just pay one low monthly fee for your martial arts and self defense
                classes at the beginning of each month.
